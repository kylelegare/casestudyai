Community First Case Study,Desciption,"Community First took a human-centric approach to digitally transforming its member services. The credit union focused its strategy on how digital channels could enable better ways to connect with members over strategies to deflect phone calls.
A chat solution alone was not going to provide the rich, personal engagement that Community First wanted for its online member experience. Adding separate chat, video and CoBrowsing apps would only create a disparate system that makes online connections complicated and even confusing.",91
Community First Case Study,Desciption,"The Glia platform provides Community First with OnScreen collaboration tools that streamline digital processes. Live Observation, for example, allows service representatives to see the same screen as a member within the Community First website and quickly understand how best to provide support. This allows service reps to proactively reach out and offer guidance for loans. Asking if a member would like help with the application as they are reviewing the auto loan page, for example.CoBrowsing gets even more proactive. With a member’s consent, reps can help them navigate the site, find online resources and even fill out applications. This accelerates the loan process for members while reducing the abandonment rate and driving up conversions. Community First immediately saw results from this proactive approach, helping it to significantly grow its loan business.",159
Community First Case Study,Desciption,"Community First explored solutions that could provide the full range of digital channels, allowing members to choose how they
connect and enabling them to transition between channels without disrupting the member experience. After evaluating a number of solutions, Community First chose Glia for its mature Digital Customer Service (DCS) platform, providing seamless member engagements across all channels.
Community First deployed Glia to support online and mobile banking, digital sales and its express team, focused on loan origination. The credit union goes the extra mile to personalize digital service.",105
Community First Case Study,Quote,"We really emphasize the human touch in our digital service. We even put a selfie image of each representative right into the engagement bubble to reinforce that. We see our members responding to this human connection in our survey feedback. They really connect with that person on the other end. They are using a digital channel and might not even see the representative, but they connected in that engagement for one-to-one member service,” said Laura Lobetti, Digital Experience Manager, Community First Credit Union.
